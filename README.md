Interpolation methods for missing joints reconstruction in human body pose estimation.

- Linear Interpolation : linear interpolation is a method of curve fitting using linear polynomials to construct new data points within the range of a discrete set of known data points.
- Nearest neighbor interpolation is a simple method of multivariate interpolation in one or more dimensions. It does not require a pre-defined function to interpolate the data.
- Inverse Distance Weighting Interpolation (IDW): is a type of deterministic method for multivariate interpolation with a known scattered set of points. The assigned values to unknown points are calculated with a weighted average of the values available at the known points.

- Akima Interpolation : is a method of interpolation for data points in the form (x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>) where i = 1, 2, ..., n. It produces a continuous curve that passes through the given points, with a continuous first derivative.
- Cubic Spline Interpolation : is a mathematical method commonly used to construct new points within the boundaries of a set of known points.
- Pchip Interpolation : is a method of interpolation for data points in the form (x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>) where i = 1, 2, ..., n. It produces a continuous curve that passes through the given points, with a continuous first derivative.
